## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

### Hydration Error Prevention

The application includes special handling to prevent React hydration errors that can occur when browser extensions like Grammarly modify the DOM:

```tsx
// In app/layout.tsx
<html lang="vi" suppressHydrationWarning>
  <head />
  <body suppressHydrationWarning>{/* Content */}</body>
</html>
```

The `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute helps prevent errors when browser extensions add attributes to HTML elements.

### Internationalization

The application features a comprehensive translation system with support for English and Vietnamese:

- Translation context provides language switching capabilities
- Language preference is saved to localStorage for persistence between sessions
- All UI elements including navigation, forms, and buttons are fully translated
- Language selection is maintained when refreshing the page

## üí° Future Enhancements
