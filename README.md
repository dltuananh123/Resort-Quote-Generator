## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

### Authentication System

The application uses NextAuth.js for secure authentication:

- **Credential Provider**: Custom implementation with username/password verification
- **JWT Session Handling**: Secure token-based sessions with proper encryption
- **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for admin and staff roles
- **Protected Routes**: Middleware that redirects unauthenticated users to login
- **User Profiles**: Personalized profile pages showing account information
- **Multilingual Support**: Login system fully translated in all supported languages

### Hydration Error Prevention

The application includes special handling to prevent React hydration errors that can occur when browser extensions like Grammarly modify the DOM:

```tsx
// In app/layout.tsx
<html lang="vi" suppressHydrationWarning>
  <head />
  <body suppressHydrationWarning>{/* Content */}</body>
</html>
```

The `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute helps prevent errors when browser extensions add attributes to HTML elements.

### Internationalization

The application features a comprehensive translation system with support for English, Vietnamese, Chinese, Russian, and Korean:

- Translation context provides language switching capabilities with country flag indicators
- Language preference is saved to localStorage for persistence between sessions
- All UI elements including navigation, forms, buttons, and footer are fully translated
- Language selection is maintained when refreshing the page
- Currency formats are adapted based on language selection
- Optimized text length for Russian language to prevent UI elements from overflowing, especially in buttons and form labels
- Culturally appropriate translations with native-language examples and naming conventions
- Standardized language codes (cn for Chinese, kr for Korean) for consistent implementation
- Complete multilingual footer with resort description, amenities, and quick links in all five languages
- Localized addresses displayed in culturally appropriate formats for each supported language
- Dynamically rendered text content that automatically adjusts based on the selected language

### UI Text Optimization

The application includes language-specific text optimizations:

- **Russian language**: Shortened phrases for better fit in UI elements without overflow
- **Chinese language**: Improved terminology for better clarity and cultural appropriateness
- **Korean language**: Enhanced natural phrasing for better user experience
- **Button text**: Condensed labels for better appearance across all screen sizes
- **Form labels**: Optimized for compact display while maintaining clarity
- **Error messages**: Streamlined for clear presentation in modals and notifications
- **Footer**: Culturally appropriate translations with consistent terminology across all site sections
- **Addresses**: Formatted according to local conventions for each language for better readability

### SVG Flag Icons

The flag icons used in the language switcher are hand-crafted SVG files that provide several advantages:

- **Minimal File Size**: Optimized SVGs take up less space and load faster than bitmap images
- **Perfect Scaling**: Vector-based icons look crisp at any size without pixelation
- **CSS Integration**: Can be styled with CSS directly for hover effects and animations
- **Accessibility**: Better screen reader support with appropriate alt text
- **Customization**: Easily modifiable for adding new language options in the future
