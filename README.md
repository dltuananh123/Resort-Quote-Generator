## üìê Favicon Setup

The application is configured to use a custom favicon:

1. The main favicon file is `public/favicon.svg`
2. The application is set up to support multiple favicon formats:
   - SVG: `/favicon.svg` (vector format, best for modern browsers)
   - ICO: `/favicon.ico` (traditional format, for older browsers)
   - PNG: Various sizes in `/favicon-*x*.png` (for different devices)

### Generating Favicon Files

The project includes a script to generate all required favicon formats from your SVG:

```bash
# Install ImageMagick first (required for conversion)
# - Windows: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php
# - Mac: brew install imagemagick
# - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install imagemagick

# Then run the generation script
npm run generate-favicon
```

If you don't have ImageMagick installed, you can manually create the favicon files using online tools like [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) or [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/).

## üí° Future Enhancements

- PDF export functionality
- Email integration for sending quotes directly to guests
